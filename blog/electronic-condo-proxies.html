          <p><em>I&#39;m on my condominium corporation&#39;s volunteer board of directors, so this is a bit of a personal project.</em></p>
<p>According to the <a href="">Ontario Condominium Act</a>, every condo needs to hold an annual general meeting of owners (the AGM). The meeting is used to conduct business that requires all owners to vote, like electing new directors and voting on by-laws. It&#39;s very similar to the AGM&#39;s held by traditional public corporations.  </p>
<p>Each meeting requires &quot;quorum&quot; -- a minimum number of owners to be present -- in order for it to be considered valid. The Condo Act mandates the minimums to be at least 25% of units in a condo. Owners can attend in person or be represented by proxy. A proxy is someone that&#39;s designated to be able to vote on the owners behalf through through a legal form.</p>
<h5>Many condos struggle to achieve quorum</h5><p>Why?</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons, but the primary one is &quot;owner apathy&quot; - owners just don&#39;t care enough to attend or submit a proxy.</p>
<h4>So what if quorum&#39;s not reached?</h4><p>Then the meeting must be adjourned and rescheduled for a later date. The challenge is you won&#39;t know if you reached quorum until the meeting commences. Having to adjourn and reschedule an in-progress meeting is a huge waste of time and money, especially for condos that lack the facilities hold it on site. There are also costs related to the service of notice (printing and postage), auditor attendance, minute takers, catering, and more.</p>
<p>In my condo&#39;s case, it&#39;s <strong>$2500 in hard costs</strong> to hold each meeting.</p>
<h4>How do condos deal with quorum now?</h4><p>They ask owners to fill out a proxy and register it with the condo immediately. It&#39;s basically the only way we can guarantee representation. But getting owners to do this is easier said than done. More often than not, it requires significant effort by the directors and management to canvas and solicit owners for proxies.  </p>
<h5><em>You want me to canvas after a full day of work? Ain&#39;t NOBODY got time for that!</em></h5><p>Directors are volunteers and often lack the time (or will) to canvas. I definitely <em>don&#39;t</em> want to spend the few precious hours I have every evening knocking on doors disturbing owners. And management shouldn’t be soliciting owners for political reasons.</p>
<p>There’s got to be a better way. Maybe some sort of online proxy form? Luckily we happen to be some kick-ass software developers.</p>
<h4>THE EXPERIMENT</h4><p>We believed we could achieve quorum through proxies alone by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making it even easier and more convenient for owners to submit them</li>
<li>Giving owners a reason to care about quorum</li>
</ol>
<h5>Making it easy - the Electronic Proxy Form</h5><div class="flex">
<img src="/assets/images/work/proxies/proxyform_ipad.jpg" alt="The Proxy Form" title="The Proxy Form">
<em>The Electronic Proxy</em>
</div>

<p>We created a simple and secure electronic proxy form web app that only registered owners could fill out. On submission, a protected PDF copy of the proxy is emailed to the owner for confirmation, then sent to the Corporation for owner verification. The proxies are printed and registered by the manager for the meeting. Simple, easy, and quick; it took owners 2 minutes on average to submit a form, all from the comfort of their web browser.</p>
<p>But the electronic proxy is only effective if owners know to use it. Fortunately our owners have opted ­in to email communications from the Corporation. We applied basic online email marketing techniques to inform owners about the proxy tool. An initial email was sent with links to the electronic proxy, then automatic recurring emails would be sent reminding owners to fill out the form. Only owners that haven’t yet filled out the form would receive the reminders.</p>
<h5>Giving owners a reason to care</h5><p>Apathy: it’s a powerful force. Ease and convenience matters not, unless owners care enough to take action. So let’s give them a reason to care about quorum.</p>
<p>It was important that our reminder emails educate owners on how quorum relates to their money.</p>

<p>Holding a meeting is expensive, in our case it’s approximately $2500 in hard costs. Having to adjourn and reschedule a meeting would cost even more money. That’s $2500 times how ever many failed meeting attempts. It’s a crazy amount of time and money to waste, and we made sure owners knew this.</p>
<h4>The Results Of Our AGM Campaign?</h4><table class="striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th data-field="id">Owners represented ...</th>
        <th data-field="2015">2015 - with online proxies</th>
        <th data-field="2014">2014 - paper only</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>In-person</td><td>19</td><td>29</td></tr>
    <tr><td>By-proxy</td><td style="color: green">56</td><td>29</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Total</td><td>75</td><td>58</td></tr><br>  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Our minimum for quorum? 25% or approximately 50 owners.</p>
<h4>Success!</h4><p>Proxy submissions in 2015 almost doubled those from 2014.  Proxies accounted for 29% of owners represented at this year&#39;s AGM. The electronic proxies alone were enough for us to achieve quorum. And because the forms are automatically sent to the Corporation, we knew we reached quorum days before our AGM. Owners definitely took to the online tool.</p>
<p>In contrast to 2014, we did not know what our attendance numbers would be until the meeting started. As a condo director, there’s a real fear and and dread at having to adjourn an in­-progress meeting and reschedule it. With the new proxy tool, that fear was gone.</p>
<p>While the overall numbers in 2015 may not look that impressive, it’s important to note that we launched the online proxy tool only 7 days before our AGM. I’m confident our numbers would be higher had we launched earlier.</p>
<h4>The best thing?</h4><p>We didn’t have to do any canvassing or solicitation. The directors and management barely lifted a finger. Ok, so we did some keyboard jockeying, but that can be done at home in our PJs.</p>
<p>We’re definitely using this strategy for future meetings.</p>
<p>I’m confident we’ll never have to fear about missing quorum again.</p>
<h4>Is This Legal?</h4><p>Yes! We have consulted with a number of top condominium law firms in Toronto, including Miller Thomson LLP, who have confirmed that these electronic proxies are legally valid. In fact, all the law firms we&#39;ve spoken with have agreed that electronic proxies, when done correctly, are better at preventing fraud than from traditional paper proxies.</p>
<h4>Want to see a demo?</h4><p>Check out <a href="http://proxy.powderkeglabs.com">http://proxy.powderkeglabs.com</a> for a generic demo version.</p>
<p>The final email to the condo corp. will use the same one entered into the &quot;Your email address&quot; field. This way you can see the full end-­to-­end workflow</p>
<h4>Want to use electronic proxies at your condo?</h4><p>Easy, <a href="mailto:kaboom@powderkeglabs.com">send us an email</a> and we&#39;ll help you set it up.</p>
