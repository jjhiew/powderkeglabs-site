            "question": "How are you different from other accelerators?",
            "answer": "Traditional accelerators provide you with seed money, but leave it to you to find technical help. We cut right to the chase and provide you with a full-time CTO and technical team to achieve your business goals."

            "question": "How will your program help our startup?",
            "answer": "We're here to give your company a technical push. Maybe you're an early startup looking to get that initial round of investment. Maybe you're ready to build your [Minimum Viable Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and get your first customers.  Or perhaps you're a later stage startup that needs help scaling and growing your product. Whatever the case, send us an [application](/#/contact) and let us know how we can help."

      },
      {
      	"question": "What's your compensation model?",
      	"answer": "It depends on your startup and the services you'll need. Generally speaking, we'll ask for a small fee,  an equity percentage, and/or a revenue share. The amounts are equivalent to the time we're investing in you. Our compensation model is flexible, so startups at any stage and resource level will be able to join the program."
      },

With that said, here are our current specialties: \n\n- Back-end: PHP, NodeJS, Java\n- Databases: MySQL, Mongo, Postgres, MSSQL, DB2\n- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JS\n- Mobile: Native iOS and Android"
